            *   If it lays to the right of known gaps, adjust it's value

                *   If any additional gaps are brought into the scope, continue

/*
Here are some steps for a basic weighted sample function:

- Take the array of weights and produce an array of cumulative values.
- e.g.: [1, 5, 2, 1, 5] --> [1, 6, 8, 9, 14]
- Generate a random number between 0 and 14.
- Find its left insertion point in the accumulated weight list.
- This will be the index of the random winner in the population.
- Eliminate the winner from future rounds of selection.
- Repeat process K times to produce a sample array.

A solution that deviates from this is welcome. The above is just the best approach I know about for this particular type of sampling.

Decomposing the work into its parts, I think it would be good to first have a good weighted choice function that picks a single population member.

    function wchoice(pop, wts) {
        // input  : pop=[1, 2, 3, 4], wts=[20, 15, 80, 2] 
        // output : 3 (most likely), 4 (least likely)
    }

Generating a sample *with replacement* is just a matter of calling `wchoice()` `k` number of times. But, to choose `k` members from the population *without replacement* is more involved. 

    function wsample(pop, wts, k) {
        // input  : pop=[1, 2, 3, 4], wts=[3, 2, 1, 4], k=2
        // output : [4, 1] (most likely), [3, 2] (least likely)
    }

**`k` must be `<=` the number of non-zero items in `weights`.**
